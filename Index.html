    <h1>About Pallotti Hill Public School</h1>
    <p>
      “To Enlighten All” is the motto of the school. A person is said to be in
      the light, if he or she is able to recognize others as his or her own
      brothers and sisters, if not the person is in darkness. It is education
      that helps a person to free himself or herself from the clutches of
      darkness and ignorance in oneself. A person with self-knowledge has light
      within to enlighten the lives of others. Thus the school in its endeavours
      aims at making every child a little lamp in this world who can enlighten
      others in turn. Pallotti Hill Public School is a co-educational English
      Medium School established by “Malabar Marian Trust, Mukkam”, an
      International Religious Society which has to its credit, a number of
      prestigious educational institutions in different parts of the country.

    <h1>ST. VINCENT PALLOTTI OUR FOUNDER & INSPIRATION</h1>
    <p>
      St.Vincent Pallotti was a Catholic priest who founded the society of the
      Catholic Apostolate (SAC), commonly known as the Pallottines, around 150
      years ago. Born on April 21, 1795, Pallotti was canonized in 1963. His
      commitment to his apostolate led him to start orphanages, night schools
      and technical institutions that exist even today. Besides, he had special
      compassion for prisoners, soldiers and the sick. He was also the spiritual
      director of several Roman Colleges. The society founded by Pallotti has
      numerous institutions in 46 countries across the globe. In India, the
      Pallottines have premier educational as well as institutions of higher
      learning in Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi,
      Jharkhand, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The Malabar Marian
      Trust which manages Pallotti Hill Public School, is a part of this
      International Society.
