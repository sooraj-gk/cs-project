    <h1>ST. VINCENT PALLOTTI OUR FOUNDER & INSPIRATION</h1>
    <p>
      St.Vincent Pallotti was a Catholic priest who founded the society of the
      Catholic Apostolate (SAC), commonly known as the Pallottines, around 150
      years ago. Born on April 21, 1795, Pallotti was canonized in 1963. His
      commitment to his apostolate led him to start orphanages, night schools
      and technical institutions that exist even today. Besides, he had special
      compassion for prisoners, soldiers and the sick. He was also the spiritual
      director of several Roman Colleges. The society founded by Pallotti has
      numerous institutions in 46 countries across the globe. In India, the
      Pallottines have premier educational as well as institutions of higher
      learning in Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi,
      Jharkhand, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The Malabar Marian
      Trust which manages Pallotti Hill Public School, is a part of this
      International Society.

    <h1>PALLOTTI HILL PUBLIC SCHOOL</h1>
    <p>
      Pallotti Hill Public School, Mukkam is the realization of a great dream of
      St. Vincent Pallotti to impart knowledge to the ordinary people and create
      a society of active and effective people. The pioneer Indian Pallottines
      cherished the dream of their founder in their mind and waited for an
      opportune time and suitable place. Finally the dream was contextualized in
      our own soil. It was Rev. Fr. Joseph Tharakkunnel, the founder of this
      school, who years back conceived the idea of starting a school for
      providing education to the children of this area, accomplishing the dream
      of St. Vincent Pallotti. It was he who found Thadaparambu hill which was
      once a barren piece of land and was later transformed into Pallotti Hill
      Public School. It was in the year 1997 the school started to function
      formally.
