    <h1>ST. VINCENT PALLOTTI OUR FOUNDER & INSPIRATION</h1>
    <p>
      St.Vincent Pallotti was a Catholic priest who founded the society of the
      Catholic Apostolate (SAC), commonly known as the Pallottines, around 150
      years ago. Born on April 21, 1795, Pallotti was canonized in 1963. His
      commitment to his apostolate led him to start orphanages, night schools
      and technical institutions that exist even today. Besides, he had special
      compassion for prisoners, soldiers and the sick. He was also the spiritual
      director of several Roman Colleges. The society founded by Pallotti has
      numerous institutions in 46 countries across the globe. In India, the
      Pallottines have premier educational as well as institutions of higher
      learning in Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi,
      Jharkhand, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The Malabar Marian
      Trust which manages Pallotti Hill Public School, is a part of this
      International Society.
